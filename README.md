# swift-php-mysql


## about

This project can be used as a basic foundation for an iOS app 

** works on Xcode 8.3.2 and Swift 3.1 **

this project includes 
    - iOS app written in *swift*
    - *PHP* backend
    - MYSQL database

I created this project because I wanted to eperiment with Swift and MySQL.

As this is a test project I used XAMMP for server and database. 


## some instructions
I assume you already know your way around xcode and xammp.


###### step 1 - setup database
Go to phpmyadmin and create a new database called "phpmysql"

CREATE TABLE Pokemons (
    id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    type varchar(15) NOT NULL
);




you should also insert a few pokemons for the lolz, my favorites are magmar and abra.


###### step 2 - setup PHP

Coming soon


###### step 3 - setup Xcode / swift 

Coming soon
